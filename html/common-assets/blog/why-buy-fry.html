    <h2>Why buy $FRY</h2>
    <p>
    OK, so you’re looking at this thing and going “yeah, it’s cool and all, and I wish you all the best, but I’m here for the gains”.
    </p>
    <p>
    So the question is why should anyone buy $FRY who’s in it for profit?
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s a few layers to the answer, but here’s the TL;DR, the products will charge real users for value delivered. That delivered value can scale quite dramatically and increase the price of $FRY directly and indirectly. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is $FRY</h2>
    <p>
    $FRY will be the governance token of Foundry, a DAO meant to build <a href="foundrydao.com/products">radically free, profitable products</a> in the blockchain space. Once governance is completed, it will grant you voting rights to Foundry Treasury spending and usage/control of Foundry assets on the blockchain (such as where the SmokeSignal.eth domain name points to). This will grant an indirect claim on the assets of Foundry, similar to how a stock grants indirect claims on a traditional company’s assets. For example, $FRY holders could vote to sell the SmokeSignal.eth domain, and distribute the proceeds to $FRY holders. We would caution against such a decision, but ultimately this is the kind of power that $FRY holders will have.
    </p>
    <h2>How is $FRY produced</h2>
    <p>
    $FRY is produced via the bucket sale, which you can access at<a href="http://sale.foundrydao.com"> sale.foundrydao.com</a>. The bucket sale is modeled on the EOS and HEX sales and puts a 30,000 $FRY up for sale every 7 hours, in return for $DAI. The $DAI goes to the treasury, where it is spent on project development. The end-of-sale supply of $FRY is 100,900,000 $FRY and the sale ends in Feb 2022 and began in July 2020. As of the time of writing we are just over halfway through sale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    $FRY can be bought on the secondary markets (like Balancer or Uniswap) or the sale. People have also figured out that they can arbitrage the bucket sale against the secondary market; meaning they can buy in the bucket sale cheaper than they can sell on the secondary market (depending on the market conditions at any given day). This is a good thing as it generates fees for the liquidity providers, and incomes for the treasury. <em>It also implies that there will be an ever decreasing inflation as the sale draws to a close. After the first month of the sale, the daily inflation of circulating $FRY was around 3%. As of the time of writing, the inflation has reduced to 0.32%. </em>As you might expect, the initial high inflation threw some people but those who understood the full implications have been acquiring. By the time this sale ends it will be at 0%. <strong><em>The implication of this is that all new supply will have reached a massively restricted point and any demand will likely spike price considerably; IE anyone with some patience could benefit disproportionately at this point. </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    30,000,000 $FRY has also been distributed to the core team to incentivise them to contribute to the system long term. 10,000,000 $FRY belongs to the DAO directly and is meant to onboard newer “talent” as time goes by to incentivise the expansion on Foundry and it’s products.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a chance that there will be some very low future issuance of $FRY to capture market mania cycles and ensure that the treasury is always flush and new talent can always be incentivised to join. This will however likely be put up to a vote to the $FRY holders and is not yet codified on the blockchain.
    </p>
    <h2>How’s the liquidity</h2>
    <p>
    As the sage Twitter bio reads “Liquidity maximalist”. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Liquidity is everything” may not be as true as “utility is everything”, but you’re a non-starter if you don’t have liquidity. To that end Foundry has incentivised several yield farms and will continue to do so as long as it appears sensible. We also introduced the novel concept of “permafrost”.
    </p>
    <p>
    What is <strong>Permafrost</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>
    The Permafrost is a special purpose ETH/FRY liquidity pool that is meant to act as a permanently available liquidity pool of last resort. The Permafrost, as the name suggests, is <a href="https://medium.com/daihard-buidlers/permafrost-un-rug-pullable-liquidity-9aa98ecf33c8">permanently frozen liquidity</a> - liquidity that cannot be removed. The pool we selected for this purpose was a Balancer ETH/FRY pool (50% - 50%) with the maximum fee of 10% set. It exists to make sure that there will always be a market for $FRY.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Permafrost’s high fee means that as arbitrage bots trade to pull pools back into price alignment, the permafrost will actually accumulate more liquidity than the bot itself can typically take as a profit. For very high value trades, aggregators, like 1inch, will also use the permafrost to fulfil some of the order. Since no one owns the permafrost, the permafrost is blissfully unaware of impermanent loss, it is the forever-hodler. The high fee means that it should, over a long time frame, accumulate a lot of both Eth and FRY. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The Permafrost also guarantees that $FRY will maintain some minimum price, even if all $FRY is sold. That price might not be very high, but it will always be there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Furthermore, some products, like the dEth token, can send its profits to the permafrost. This is even better than a buy-back and burn as it;
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Lifts the lifetime liquidity of $FRY
    
    <li>Lifts the price of $FRY every time someone enters or exits dEth.
    
    <li>Lifts the intermediate liquidity of $FRY as others can provide liquidity on the same pool and benefit from the high fee and automated buyers like the dEth contract or whatever future Foundry products send their profits to the permafrost. 
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
    Foundry currently has three products in various stages of development.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://smokesignal.zone">SmokeSignal</a> - The flagship product, it is live and operational today. It facilitates and guarantees free and uncensored speech. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://daihard.exchange">DAIHard</a> - A peer to peer onboarding system to get people from their local currency, into crypto. This project is dormant at the moment until Foundry can secure more resources.
    </p>
    <p>
    dEth - A tokenized, perpetual long contract on the price of Eth that is entirely decentralized. It uses MakerDAO’s DAI system and DeFiSaver’s automation system to build a token on top op Leveraged positions of Ether. Giving the “Eth is money” crowd a way to buy Ether with their Ether as they buy Ether. Currently a beta version is live on mainnet with a main version currently in the quality assurance phase. 
    </p>
    <h2>Future products</h2>
    <p>
    The idea with Foundry is that it will build systems that generate profit that will somehow accrue to the $FRY holders. This could happen in a few different ways, given a profit stream: 
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Increase the Foundry treasury - which would translate into future investments or dividends.
    
    <li>Increase Foundry liquidity - which also increases the price since only the non-FRY side of the pair is provided. 
    
    <li>Reduction in $FRY supply - burns causing a restriction in $FRY supply.

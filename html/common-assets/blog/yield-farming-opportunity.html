<h1>Yield Farming Opportunity</h1>

<p>
Foundry now also distributes $FRY for liquidity providers on the Uniswap ETHFRY pool. 
</p>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>


<p>
Liquidity is an extremely important aspect of any token based crypto currency project. Shallow liquidity means that small buys or sells of the token will result in disproportionate price movements. These price swings would deter many larger buyers as their purchases would significantly shift the price and expose them to losses from existing holders selling. This dynamic of course always exists but on thin markets their effects are felt much more immediately. What one does not want for instance is a buy order of say $1,000 to influence the price much more than 2%. 
</p>
<h2>Long term holders</h2>


<p>
Ultimately the only thing that grants a token value is the real world value that the projects or projects it represents, gives to real world users. It is possible for the token to have a valuation above or below this value if the market believes either that the token will represent more value in the future or less value. What is desirable in this case is a situation where market participants who are “long” the token (IE believe it will deliver long term value), have the opportunity to buy the token without significantly shifting the price such that most of their investment can immediately be traded away by speculators. 
</p>
<h2>Liquidity provision</h2>


<p>
One of the revolutionary developments in the Ethereum ecosystem have been the development of Automated Market Makers (AMM) such as Uniswap and Balancer. These markets incentivize funds to be provided against trading pairs of tokens. For instance, there is currently a Uniswap trading pair for $FRY against Ether. The incentive comes from trading fees that the AMM gives to Liquidity Providers (LPs). The problem unfortunately with the current crop of AMMs is that they expose LPs to a phenomenon known as Impermanent Loss (IL) which is caused by the automated price discovery mechanism of AMMs. When trading volumes on a pair of tokens is very high, the fees might be sufficient to overcome the impermanent loss. Uniswap locks this fee at 0.3%, Balancer allows each pool to have a unique fee from 0% to 10%. Higher fees might compensate the LP sooner but deter trade.

<h2>Interactions with the FRY sale</h2>


<p>
In the case of Foundry an additional dynamic exists during the sale. The FRY sale is quite long running (around 19 months) and many market participants have figured out they can arbitrage the sale against the secondary market (IE buy low at sale.foundrydao.com and sell high on Uniswap). This does however have the effect that the shallower the liquidity, the more deleterious the effect of this arbitrage is on the market price. 
</p>
<h2>Overcoming Impermanent Loss</h2>


<p>
When we combine the goal of getting $FRY into the hands of long term holders, with the goal of providing deep liquidity for other long holders to enter and speculators to trade against, we need to overcome the barrier of impermanent loss. To do this we now provide $FRY as a reward to anyone who provides liquidity to our Uniswap ETHFRY pool and stakes that liquidity with our Yield Farming contract. We’re starting by giving away 2,000,000 $FRY over a 30 day period. This will hopefully reward long holders of $FRY sufficiently to provide extra liquidity and support the project in this fashion. <br><br>You can participate in the yield farming experiment at <a href="https://dashboard.foundrydao.com/#/farm">https://dashboard.foundrydao.com/#/farm</a>
